#### BikeBin

![Bikebin page](images/bikebin.png)

* [BikeBin](http://bikebin.co) is an ongoing project that allows proud bike owners to share their bikes with other passionate enthusiasts.
* Currently under development at [github.com/benrbrook/bikebin](https://github.com/benrbrook/bikebin), with a live version at [bikebin.co](http://bikebin.co).
* Built with Meteor, which runs on top of Node.js to allow for both front and back end development in JavaScript.


#### SF Crime Classification

![SF Crime](images/sfcrimeviz.png)

* Final project for CS 434 Machine Learning.
* We took 12 years of crime data from the City of San Francisco.
* Predicted crime category (assault, robbery, vandalism, etc.) based on time and location.
* Compared the viability of different classifiers (k-NN, random forest, etc.).
* High accuracy (log loss of 3.5) with tuned hyperparameters. 
* Created a report [viewable here](documents/san-francisco-crime.pdf).
